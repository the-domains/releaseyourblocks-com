Rupture of the Achilles tendon is another common athletic
injury. Complete rupture is usually treated with surgery followed by a long
recovery period. By using SK reflexes and attending to the emotional component
of the injury (both before and after surgery) recovery time can be
significantly reduced. In Achilles tendinitis the tendon becomes inflamed and
painful and can take weeks to settle. Chronic problems like these may resolve
with Specialized Kinesiology.
