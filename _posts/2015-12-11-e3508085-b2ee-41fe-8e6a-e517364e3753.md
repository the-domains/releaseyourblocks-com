**_The shoulder and
arm_****__**

Clients rarely ask for help because of imbalance in their
muscle energy -- rather they come complaining of pain, restricted movement,
weakness, or a combination of these. The condition may or may not be the result
of an injury. Frequently they will have seen another practitioner who has given
them anti-inflammatory medication, and sent them for physiotherapy or massage.
The person may have had a poorer response to the treatment that they expected
and now is shopping around for an alternative.
