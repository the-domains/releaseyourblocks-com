**_The elbow, wrist
and hand_**

Evaluate and balance muscle energy imbalance in the**elbow, wrist and hand regions. **There
are so many people today suffering with occupationally related disorders in
these areas. 

**Clients comes complaining of pain, restricted movement,
weakness, or a combination of these. The condition may or may not be the result
of an injury. **Frequently they will have seen another practitioner who has given
them anti-inflammatory medication, and sent them for physiotherapy or massage.
The person may have had a poorer response to the treatment than they expected
and now is shopping around for an alternative. 

We will not only work with the physical but with the mental,
emotional and metaphysical aspects of elbow, wrist and hand problems. The
expression that clients use such as: "I'm up to my elbows in..." can be very
significant clues to client management. 

We want to increase function and performance. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/03bd58a6-8328-4db6-8767-62ad18422449.jpg)
