Shoulder Problems
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/da801621-16a2-415c-92d9-980c7c46c38d.jpg)

Clients rarely ask for help because of imbalance in their
muscle energy -- rather they come complaining of pain, restricted movement,
weakness, or a combination of these. The condition may or may not be the result
of an injury. Frequently they will have seen another practitioner who has given
them anti-inflammatory medication, and sent them for physiotherapy or massage.
The person may have had a poorer response to the treatment that they expected
and now is shopping around for an alternative.

The purpose of this workshop is to develop skill and
understanding in evaluating and balancing muscles energy imbalances in the 22
muscles of the shoulder girdle. We will not only work with the physical but
with the mental, emotional and metaphysical aspects of shoulder problems. The
expressions that clients use such as: "I'm shouldering my burdens" can be very
significant clues to client management.
